1. The system is currently not very good at dealing with upper case or punctuation. Avoid both. 

2. If all queries (such as "is ray a person") return false, try the following

        - Check that you have either the simulator or the kr_execution node up (they might have crashed)

        - Check your Clingo version. Currently, if you followed all the instructions on the README of this repo, it should work with Clingo 4. For 
          other versions, consult someone who knows Clingo to make appropriate modifications

        - Check the file bwi_kr_execution/src/StaticFacts.cpp. Search for the line "boost::replace_all(line, "%#hide", "#show");" (line 30 or 
          thereabouts). If you don't have it but have "boost::replace_all(line, "#hide", "#show");", add the extra '%' character. 

        - Check the file bwi_kr_execution/launch/bwi_kr_execution.launch. Look for the line 
          "<arg name="domain" default="$(find bwi_kr_execution)/domain/" />" (line 4 or thereabouts). It will either end with domain or 
          domain_simulation. Open bwi_kr_execution/domain/hri_facts.asp and bwi_kr_execution/domain_simulation/hri_facts.asp. They must both have 
          some lines starting with '%#' in the end. If only one of them does, copy these lines into the end of the other.

        - If none of the above steps help, try running the ros service to Clingo by running 
                rosservice call static_fact_query "[{name: hasoffice, params: [ray, l3_512]}]"
          in a terminal (with either the simulator or the bwi_kr_execution node running). You probably still need to talk to someone who has used 
          the project but the output of this is useful

        - If the previous step failed, ask someone who knows Clingo to create a direct Clingo query and test if your Clingo is working. Again, in 
          this case, there is probably an actual bug to be fixed by someone who knows the code to some extent.>

3. If the system hangs after displaying 'ACTION:<something>', it is trying to execute the action. This will work only if you have the simulator 
   running.

4. If you get one or more occurrences of an error whose stack trace ends with "rospy.exceptions.ROSInterruptException: rospy shutdown", this would 
   most likely have occurred in the dialog after one where you terminated the execution of an action using a Ctrl+C. You should not terminate 
   actions prematurely this way and if they are not running, either the simulator is not up or there is a bug and you need to talk to someone who 
   knows the code.

5. Errors in online interfaces - Logs are available at /u/www/logs/www.cs.utexas.edu but they are common so have logs mixed up from several 
   machines. In geenral not useful.
