Shared information between a set of H\-M\-Ms.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$hmm.\-h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Shared information between a set of H\-M\-Ms. 

We assume that the initial state is emitting and that the transition matrix is n\-\_\-emit\-\_\-state x (n\-\_\-emit\-\_\-state+1), where the extra destination dimension correponds to the non-\/emitting final or exit state. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
src/libpocketsphinx/{\bf hmm.\-h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
