\subsection{Detailed Description}
A note by A\-R\-C\-H\-A\-N at 20050510\-: Technically what we use is so-\/called \char`\"{}hash table with buckets\char`\"{} which is very nice way to deal with external hashing. 

There are definitely better ways to do internal hashing (i.\-e. when everything is stored in the memory.) In Sphinx 3, this is a reasonable practice because hash table is only used in lookup in initialization or in lookups which is not critical for speed. Another note by A\-R\-C\-H\-A\-N at 20050703\-: To use this data structure properly, it is very important to realize that the users are required to handle memory allocation of the C-\/style keys. The hash table will not make a copy of the memory allocated for any of the C-\/style key. It will not allocate memory for it. It will not delete memory for it. As a result, the following code sniplet will cause memory leak.

Each hash table is identified by a hash\-\_\-table\-\_\-t structure. hash\-\_\-table\-\_\-t.\-table is pre-\/allocated for a user-\/controlled max size, and is initially empty. As new entries are created (using hash\-\_\-enter()), the empty entries get filled. If multiple keys hash to the same entry, new entries are allocated and linked together in a linear list.
