%feature("docstring")  Config::init "

Create a cmd_ln_t from NULL-terminated list of arguments.

This function creates a cmd_ln_t from a NULL-terminated list of
argument strings. For example, to create the equivalent of passing
\"-hmm foodir -dsratio 2 -lm bar.lm\" on the command-line:

config = cmd_ln_init(NULL, defs, TRUE, \"-hmm\", \"foodir\",
\"-dsratio\", \"2\", \"-lm\", \"bar.lm\", NULL);

Note that for simplicity, all arguments are passed as strings,
regardless of the actual underlying type.

Parameters:
-----------

inout_cmdln:  Previous command-line to update, or NULL to create a new
one.

defn:  Array of argument name definitions, or NULL to allow any
arguments.

strict:  Whether to fail on duplicate or unknown arguments.

%feature("docstring")  Config::parse_r "

Parse a list of strings into argumetns.

Parse the given list of arguments (name-value pairs) according to the
given definitions. Argument values can be retrieved in future using
cmd_ln_access(). argv[0] is assumed to be the program name and
skipped. Any unknown argument name causes a fatal error. The routine
also prints the prevailing argument values (to stderr) after parsing.

It is currently assumed that the strings in argv are allocated
statically, or at least that they will be valid as long as the
cmd_ln_t returned from this function. Unpredictable behaviour will
result if they are freed or otherwise become invalidated.

%feature("docstring")  FrontEnd::get_output_size "

Get the dimensionality of the output of this front-end object.

This is guaranteed to be the number of values in one frame of output

This function generates up to *inout_nframes of features, or as many
as can be generated from *inout_nsamps samples.

On exit, the inout_spch, inout_nsamps, and inout_nframes parameters
are updated to point to the remaining sample data, the number of
remaining samples, and the number of frames processed, respectively.
This allows you to call this repeatedly to process a large block of
audio in small (say, 5-frame) chunks:

int16 *bigbuf, *p; mfcc_t **cepstra; int32 nsamps; int32 nframes = 5;

cepstra = (mfcc_t **) ckd_calloc_2d(nframes, fe_get_output_size(fe),

inout_nsamps:  Input: Pointer to maximum number of samples to process.
Output: Number of samples remaining in input buffer.

buf_cep:  Two-dimensional buffer (allocated with ckd_calloc_2d())

%feature("docstring")  FrontEnd::process_utt "

Process a block of samples, returning as many frames as possible.

This function processes all the samples in a block of data and returns
a newly allocated block of feature vectors. This block needs to be
freed with fe_free_2d() after use.

It is possible for there to be some left-over data which could not fit
in a complete frame. This data can be processed with fe_end_utt().

This function is deprecated in favor of fe_process_frames().

0 for success, <0 for failure (see enum fe_error_e) ";

%feature("docstring")  FrontEnd::mfcc_to_float "

Convert a block of mfcc_t to float32 (can be done in-place) ";

%feature("docstring")  FrontEnd::float_to_mfcc "

Convert a block of float32 to mfcc_t (can be done in-place) ";

%feature("docstring")  FrontEnd::logspec_to_mfcc "

Process one frame of log spectra into MFCC using discrete cosine
transform.

This uses a variant of the DCT-II where the first frequency bin is
scaled by 0.5. Unless somebody misunderstood the DCT-III equations and
thought that's what they were implementing here, this is ostensibly
done to account for the symmetry properties of the DCT-II versus the
DFT - the first coefficient of the input is assumed to be repeated in
the negative frequencies, which is not the case for the DFT. (This
begs the question, why not just use the DCT-I, since it has the
appropriate symmetry properties...) Moreover, this is bogus since the
mel-frequency bins on which we are doing the DCT don't extend to the
edge of the DFT anyway.

This also means that the matrix used in computing this DCT can not be
made orthogonal, and thus inverting the transform is difficult.
Therefore if you want to do cepstral smoothing or have some other
reason to invert your MFCCs, use fe_logspec_dct2() and its inverse
fe_logspec_dct3() instead.

Also, it normalizes by 1/nfilt rather than 2/nfilt, for some reason.
";

%feature("docstring")  FrontEnd::logspec_dct2 "

Convert log spectra to MFCC using DCT-II.

This uses the \"unitary\" form of the DCT-II, i.e. with a scaling
factor of sqrt(2/N) and a \"beta\" factor of sqrt(1/2) applied to the
cos(0) basis vector (i.e. the one corresponding to the DC coefficient
in the output). ";

%feature("docstring")  FrontEnd::mfcc_dct3 "

Convert MFCC to log spectra using DCT-III.

This uses the \"unitary\" form of the DCT-III, i.e. with a scaling
factor of sqrt(2/N) and a \"beta\" factor of sqrt(1/2) applied to the
cos(0) basis vector (i.e. the one corresponding to the DC coefficient
in the input). ";

%feature("docstring")  feat_init "

Initialize feature module to use the selected type of feature stream.

One-time only initialization at the beginning of the program. Input

streams in the dynamic feature type must be one, as with LDA.

After adding a subvector specification, the output of feature
computation will be split into multiple subvectors, and
feat_array_alloc() will allocate pointers accordingly. The number of
streams will remain the

Feature vectors are computed for the entire segment specified, by
including additional surrounding or padding frames to accommodate the
feature windows.

Number of frames of feature vectors computed if successful; -1 if any

specifies extension or absolute path, then these are not applied. The
default extension is defined by the application. ";

%feature("docstring")  Feature::s2mfc2live "

Feature computation routine for live mode decoder.

This function computes features for blocks of incoming data. It
retains an internal buffer for computing deltas, which means that the
number of output frames will not necessarily equal the number of input
frames.

It is very important to realize that the number of output frames can
be greater than the number of input frames, specifically when endutt
is true. It is guaranteed to never exceed *inout_ncep +
feat_window_size(fcb). You MUST have allocated at least that many
frames in ofeat, or you will experience a buffer overflow.

If beginutt and endutt are both true, CMN_CURRENT and AGC_MAX will be
done. Otherwise only CMN_PRIOR and AGC_EMAX will be done.

If beginutt is false, endutt is true, and the number of input frames
exceeds the input size, then end-of-utterance processing won't
actually be done. This condition can easily be checked, because
*inout_ncep will equal the return value on exit, and will also be
smaller than the value of *inout_ncep on entry.

The FSG spec begins with the line containing the keyword FSG_BEGIN. It
has an optional fsg name string. If not present, the FSG has the empty
string as its name.

Following the FSG_BEGIN declaration is the number of states, the start
state, and the final state, each on a separate line. States are
numbered in the range [0 .. <numberofstate>-1].

These are followed by all the state transitions, each on a separate
line, and terminated by the FSG_END line. A state transition has the
given probability of being taken, and emits the given word. The word
emission is optional; if word-string omitted, it is an epsilon or null
transition.

Comments can also be embedded within the FSG body proper (i.e. between
FSG_BEGIN and FSG_END): any line with a # character in col 1 is

%feature("docstring")  NGramModel::apply_weights "

Apply a language weight, insertion penalty, and unigram weight to a

actually need. Call ngram_prob() if you want the \"raw\" N-Gram

Parameters:

language weight. ";

%feature("docstring")  NGramModel::ngram_score "

Get the score (scaled, interpolated log-probability) for a general
N-Gram.

The argument list consists of the history words (as null-terminated
strings) of the N-Gram, in reverse order, followed by NULL. Therefore,
if you wanted to get the N-Gram score for \"a whole joy\", you would
call:

score = ngram_score(model, \"joy\", \"whole\", \"a\", NULL);

This is not the function to use in decoding, because it has some
overhead for looking up words. Use ngram_ng_score(), ngram_tg_score(),
or ngram_bg_score() instead. In the future there will probably be a
version that takes a general language model state object, to support
suffix-array LM and things like that.

If one of the words is not in the LM's vocabulary, the result will
depend on whether this is an open or closed vocabulary language model.
For an open-vocabulary model, unknown words are all mapped to the
unigram <UNK> which has a non-zero probability and also participates
in higher-order N-Grams. Therefore, you will get a score of some sort
in this case.

For a closed-vocabulary model, unknown words are impossible and thus
have zero probability. Therefore, if word is unknown, this function
will return a \"zero\" log-probability, i.e. a large negative number.
To obtain this number for comparison, call ngram_zero(). ";

Get the unknown word ID for a language model.

Language models can be either \"open vocabulary\" or \"closed

zero unigram probability to unknown words, while the latter does not
allow unknown words (or, equivalently, it assigns them zero
probability). If this is a closed vocabulary model, this function will

Read a class definition file and add classes to a language model.

This function assumes that the class tags have already been defined as

be added to the vocabulary as special in-class words. For this reason
is is necessary that they not have the same names as any words in the
general unigram distribution. The convention is to suffix them with

%feature("docstring")  Config::ngram_model_set_init "

Create a set of language models sharing a common space of word IDs.

This function creates a meta-language model which groups together a
set of language models, synchronizing word IDs between them. To use
this language model, you can either select a submodel to use
exclusively using ngram_model_set_select(), or interpolate between
scores from all models. To do the latter, you can either pass a non-
NULL value of the weights parameter, or re-activate interpolation
later on by calling ngram_model_set_interp().

In order to make this efficient, there are some restrictions on the
models that can be grouped together. The most important (and currently
the only) one is that they must all share the same log-math
parameters.

Parameters:
-----------

config:  Any configuration parameters to be shared between models.

models:  Array of pointers to previously created language models.

names:  Array of strings to use as unique identifiers for LMs.

weights:  Array of weights to use in interpolating LMs, or NULL for no
interpolation.

n_models:  Number of elements in the arrays passed to this function.

%feature("docstring")  NGramModel::ngram_ng_score "

Quick general N-Gram score lookup. ";

%feature("docstring")  NGramModel::ngram_score "

Get the score (scaled, interpolated log-probability) for a general
N-Gram.

The argument list consists of the history words (as null-terminated
strings) of the N-Gram, in reverse order, followed by NULL. Therefore,
if you wanted to get the N-Gram score for \"a whole joy\", you would
call:

score = ngram_score(model, \"joy\", \"whole\", \"a\", NULL);

This is not the function to use in decoding, because it has some
overhead for looking up words. Use ngram_ng_score(), ngram_tg_score(),
or ngram_bg_score() instead. In the future there will probably be a
version that takes a general language model state object, to support
suffix-array LM and things like that.

If one of the words is not in the LM's vocabulary, the result will
depend on whether this is an open or closed vocabulary language model.
For an open-vocabulary model, unknown words are all mapped to the
unigram <UNK> which has a non-zero probability and also participates
in higher-order N-Grams. Therefore, you will get a score of some sort
in this case.

For a closed-vocabulary model, unknown words are impossible and thus
have zero probability. Therefore, if word is unknown, this function
will return a \"zero\" log-probability, i.e. a large negative number.
To obtain this number for comparison, call ngram_zero(). ";

%feature("docstring")  NGramModel::ngram_probv "

%feature("docstring")  Config::ngram_model_set_init "

Create a set of language models sharing a common space of word IDs.

This function creates a meta-language model which groups together a
set of language models, synchronizing word IDs between them. To use
this language model, you can either select a submodel to use
exclusively using ngram_model_set_select(), or interpolate between
scores from all models. To do the latter, you can either pass a non-
NULL value of the weights parameter, or re-activate interpolation
later on by calling ngram_model_set_interp().

In order to make this efficient, there are some restrictions on the
models that can be grouped together. The most important (and currently
the only) one is that they must all share the same log-math
parameters.

Parameters:
-----------

config:  Any configuration parameters to be shared between models.

models:  Array of pointers to previously created language models.

names:  Array of strings to use as unique identifiers for LMs.

weights:  Array of weights to use in interpolating LMs, or NULL for no
interpolation.
